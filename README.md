# TSF-Data-Science-Business-Analytics-Intern
This repository contains the projects and tasks completed during my Data Science & Business Analytics Internship at The Sparks Foundation.

## Introduction
During my internship at The Sparks Foundation, I worked on various data science and business analytics projects. This repository showcases my work, including code, data, and results, to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I gained during this period.

## Projects

### 1. Student Performance Prediction
- **Objective:** Predict the percentage score of students based on study hours using linear regression.
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Notebook:** [`Predicting_Student_Performance_Using_Linear_Regression.ipynb`](https://github.com/syifagit/TSF-Data-Science-Business-Analytics-Intern/blob/main/Predicting_Student_Performance_Using_Linear_Regression.ipynb)
- **Description:** This project involves developing a predictive model that estimates a student's score based on their study hours. The project demonstrates data loading, visualization, preparation, model training, prediction, and evaluation using linear regression.
  
## Tools and Technologies
- **Python:** For data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning model training and evaluation.

## Steps Involved

### Project 1: Student Performance Prediction
1. **Loading and Exploring the Data:**
   - Loaded the dataset and performed initial exploration.
2. **Visualizing the Data:**
   - Created a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between study hours and scores.
3. **Preparing the Data:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
4. **Training the Model:**
   - Used linear regression to train a model on the training data.
5. **Making Predictions:**
   - Used the trained model to predict scores based on study hours.
6. **Evaluating the Model:**
   - Assessed the model's performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
7. **Results:**
   - The model showed a strong positive correlation between study hours and percentage scores, indicating that more study hours generally lead to higher scores.

## Results
The linear regression model developed in the student performance prediction project demonstrated a strong positive correlation between study hours and percentage scores, suggesting that students who study more hours tend to achieve higher scores.

## Future Work
- Explore other regression techniques for better accuracy.
- Increase the dataset size for more robust model training.
- Implement additional evaluation metrics to further assess model performance.
